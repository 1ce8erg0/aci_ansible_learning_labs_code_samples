## Cisco DevNet Learning Labs: Code Samples for the ACI Ansible Learning Labs

These code samples are for Learning Labs displayed within the [Cisco DevNet Learning Labs system](https://learninglabs.cisco.com).

Contributions are welcome, and we are glad to review changes through pull requests. See [contributing.md](contributing.md) for details.

Once approved, create a release that we use to publish in our Learning Labs system. 

The goal of these learning labs is to ensure a 'hands-on' learning approach rather than just theory or instructions.

## About these Learning Labs Code Samples

The YAML files contain Ansible playbooks for various scenarios of applying network configurations.
